#!/bin/bash

# This script automates the initial setup and hardening of a new Debian-based server.
# It must be run as root.
#
# The script will:
# 1. Create a new sudo user.
# 2. Move the root SSH key to the new user.
# 3. Harden the SSH server configuration.
# 4. Install bat, eza, and Docker.

# --- Configuration ---
readonly USERNAME="finxol"
# Define a temporary password. This will be immediately expired.
# WARNING: This password will be stored in the script file and potentially
# in your shell history. This is an acceptable risk for a brand new server
# where the password will be changed upon first login.
readonly TEMP_PASS="password"

# --- Script Execution ---

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e
# Treat unset variables as an error.
set -u
# Ensure that pipelines return the exit status of the last command to fail.
set -o pipefail

# --- Helper Functions ---
